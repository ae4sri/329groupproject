# Stay Safe, Have Fun

Project hosted here: https://ae4sri.github.io/329groupproject/

## About

We've created an informative website about information security, friendly to the average user. The website contains a game, quiz, and comic, all created
with the intent of being fun, but also informative.

## How to Run

Assuming node.js is installed, simply download the repository, enter the directory for it in your command line, run `npm install`, and then run 
`npm start` to run a local copy of the website. 

Credits can all be found on the website in the "About" page.
